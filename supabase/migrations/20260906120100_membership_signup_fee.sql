-- The joining fee was folded into memberships.price_paisa and never stored on
-- its own, so a printed invoice could not name it as a line. Keep the money
-- exactly as it is -- subtotal, invoice and every guard are untouched -- and
-- just record the split alongside it.
--
-- Rows written before this migration carry 0, which means "not separated",
-- not "no fee was charged". A document renders them as a single line, and that
-- is correct: the split does not exist for them and must never be guessed back
-- from membership_plans.signup_fee_paisa, which may have been repriced since.

alter table public.memberships

    check (signup_fee_paisa >= 0);


-- Re-emitted verbatim from 20260905120700_membership_rpcs.sql; the only change
-- is that signup_fee is now also written to its own column. Still SECURITY
-- INVOKER: the RLS policies are the tenant boundary.
